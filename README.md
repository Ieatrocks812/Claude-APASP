Prompt naming format:

Prompt [course] MK[#] : [fork] : [upstream]

Course: 
  -The course is the abbreviated name for the AP course, for example, if the prompt is for AP United States History, the course would be USH; For AP Biology, it would be Bio.
  -If there is more than one course the prompt works with, put a "+" between the two course names, for example: USH+Bio, or WH+Calc.
  -If the prompt has no specific course, put "General" where the course name would go.

MK:
  -If the version you are creating is the first for its AP course, put "1".
  -If the version you are creating is not the first for a specific AP course or General, it is the next in the sequence; for example, if the last version of a Bio prompt was MK4, the next would be Bio MK5.
  -Even if the other version is present in a different fork, it is still the next for its fork.
  -For example, if the last HuG prompt was MK3 and a fork of Prompt MK1, and the new one is a fork of Prompt General MK2, the name of the new version is still MK4.
  -To sum it up in simpler terms, the numbering is based on the AP course, not the lineage.

fork:
  -The name prompt version that this was based on, includes the whole name.
  -If the prompt is not based on any other prompt, leave it blank with a "-".
  -This should be filled out with the course name and mark (MK) of the forked prompt.

upstream:
  -If you follow a stream of forks until you hit an original (not forked) prompt, you have found the upstream, that goes here.
  -If a prompt is an original and is not forked from any other prompt, put "Original" here.
  -This should be filled out with the course name and mark (MK) of the upstream prompt.
  -If the fork and upstream are the same prompt, type "fsu" (fork same as upstream).


Examples:

Prompt Bio MK4 : Bio MK3 : General MK2

Prompt USH+WH MK1 : WH MK2 : fsu

Prompt General MK7 : - : Original

Prompt HuG MK1 : WH MK3 : General MK1

Prompt HuG MK2 : General MK2 : fsu

Prompt Bio+HuG MK4 : Bio+Hug MK3 : General MK2


Course Abbreviations:
Bio = Biology
HuG = Human Geography
WH = World History(: Modern)
USH = United States History
